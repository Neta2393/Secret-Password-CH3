# Secret-Password-CH3

## Purpose

The purpose of this README is to explain the function and purpose of this repository. The name of this repository is secret password ch3, it is the third challenge that I have worked on in my coding bootcamp. I chose a name for the repo that was creative but still has something to do with what the challenge entails. The starter code needed adjustments and needed things added to it to allow the user to be given a random password when clicking the generate password funtion of the webpage. This README will explain the different files and attachments that are included in the repo. 

## Assets Folder
The assets folder consists of a JavaScript (script.js) file and a CSS style sheet. The CSS file already contianed starter code that was complete so I focused on the JavaScript. The first thing that I wanted to do was ensure that all of the files that I needed were placed in the correct file so that when I ran the HTML it was accessible and was able to function the way that I wanted it to. After all the files and contents of the asset folder were placed in the appropriate places I focused in on debugging the starter-code. 

## Functionality
The function of the website is that you should be able to click generate password and be asked a series of questions. The first function of the webpage is that you will write a number between 8 and 128. If you type in a number that is less than 8 or more than  128 the webpage will alert you that the number is not within the acceptable range. After the user goes through the prompts and and press OK the webpage will generate a password that is a mix of numbers,uppercase and lowercase letters and special characters. 

## Accountability

This challenge proved to be challenging. While trying to debug my code I hit a few bumps and although the password generator reads as undefined I learned alot. I worked on this up until the very end and I am proud of what I accomplished. In the spirit of not getting 0 I am conceeding to the password challenge just for tonight so I can turn it in on time. I will continue to look at the code and try to find where I went wrong. You can do all but generate a code.
